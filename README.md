## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early prediction of diabetes can lead to timely intervention and better management. This project aims to create a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on various health parameters.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset, handling missing values and scaling features.
- **Model Training:** Implements several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses cross-validation and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of different models.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualizations to compare model performance and understand feature importance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
